# Time-Series-Analysis-App-Using-R-Shinny
An interactive R Shiny app for time series analysis using CSV/XLSX data. Features ADF test, ACF/PACF, smoothing, SARIMA, GARCH models, and PDF report generation. Built with ggplot2, forecast, tseries, and more. Simple UI for users with no coding skills. Open-source and easy to run locally.

This repository contains a powerful and user-friendly R Shiny dashboard application developed for performing time series analysis. The app is designed to work with both .csv and .xlsx files and offers a wide range of features for exploring and analyzing time series data. It provides interactive tools to visualize the series, check for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, plot ACF and PACF graphs, and apply various smoothing techniques such as moving average, exponential smoothing, and Holt-Winters method. The app also supports advanced modeling techniques like SARIMA and GARCH, and offers forecast plots and residual analysis for evaluating model performance.

The technologies used in building this app include R Shiny for the web interface, shinydashboard for UI components, ggplot2 for plotting, and statistical packages like forecast, tseries, TTR, xts, and rugarch. It also supports rmarkdown and knitr for automatically generating downloadable PDF reports based on the user's analysis. The app provides a seamless and interactive experience for anyone looking to explore time series data â€” whether for academic, business, or research purposes.

To use this app, simply clone the repository, install the required R packages, and run the app.R file. The uploaded file should contain a numeric variable representing the time series, and users must provide the correct frequency (e.g., 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly data). The application interface is designed to be intuitive and does not require any coding knowledge. It even includes validation for data format and feedback messages for errors. Additionally, the app allows users to download a detailed analysis report in PDF format with one click.
